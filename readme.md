# Semantic Commit Messages

Semcommit is a tool that allows you to structure your commit messages. The CLI will ask you for the type of commit, the project you are working on and the messages that decribes your commit.

```
$ semcommit
Format your commit message:
type(project): message

✔ type · feat
✔ project · docs
? message (some message) › ...
```
